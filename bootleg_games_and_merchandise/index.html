	 <h2><u>History of bootleg games</u></h2>
	<p>The are different type of bootlegs games and not are technally illgel here are some type of bootlegs game  </p>

	  <p>1.Unlicensed games: most bootlegs would fall under the catergory of unlicensed games since most were not approved by the creators of most video game consoles but still functions the same as a reuglar game.Not all unlicensed games a good example would be "battle kid" even through it takes inspiration from game like mega man it doesn't rip off it's core mechanics or concept but it isn't legally licensed by nintendo.</p>
	 
	  <p>2.Hacks: Hacks are games that are taken by hackers and they were remixed a little bit by changing up the story or reskining the game. Some good illegal hacks of games are "sepai go" and "league of titans" both are games made by bootleg chinse developers who just reskin triple A games. not all hack are illgel a good example of this would be super mario bros. 2 (usa), the game itself is a reskin of japan exclusive game "doki doki panic" but it was legally licensed by nintendo and company who owns "doki doki panic"</p>

	 <p>3.Pirateing: Pirateing is an illegal way to downland games and burn them onto cd's and cartridges. Most piraters makes most of their money by sell pirated cartidges of games, most game devolpers put something in their games to essentaily make their game unplayable if the game finds out that it is pirated. an example would be in earthbound were the cartridge would display and anti-pricary screen and frezze andif you managed to get pass the screen, the game would spanwn hard eneimes to make the game less enjoyable and freeze in certain places</p>
 
     <p> The first "Bootleg game" to ever exist is called "Super Marou"and it was made in 1988. "Super marou" is an unlicensed adult game made for the nintendo famicon only 7 copies of the game were ever releasedwhich also makes it the one of the rarest bootleg games.  </p>
