        <H2><u>The Pokemon Series   </u></H2>
        
        <h3><u> Priated versions </u></h3>
        <p> A lot of Pokemon cartrides can be priaters.There are alot of priaters that succefully sell priated copies of Pokemon games, The priaters<br> that are selling Pokemon cartridges are very experirenced since most of the times the only difference between the real verison of the<br>game and priated verison would most likely be a slight difference in the nintendo seal of quality or the ESRB rating, a slight change of color<br> on the cartridge or the sticker, or it some numbers could be missing from the cartridges but sometimes the priaters on so good you<br> have to look inside the cartidge and look at wiring for the game.  </p>

     	<H3><u>Bootlegs games</u></H3>
        <p>.There are tons of bootleg games made for the pokemon series in fact they went to release pokemon games on consles they didn't even have licensed pokemon games like the N.E.S., S.N.E.S., and the Sega genesis.It is very easy to tell what games are legitamate and licensed games.Usally it'll say pocket monsters instead of pokemon and it'll feature a fake pokemon on the cartidge<P>
